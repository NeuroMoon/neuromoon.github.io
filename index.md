I am a postdoc in Robbe Gorisâ€™ lab at UT Austin where I study visual perception and decision making. I use a combination of psychophysical experiments, computational models and monkey electrophysiology to uncover how sensory information and uncertainty associated with it are encoded in the brain and transformed into perceptions and thoughts that drive behavior.
