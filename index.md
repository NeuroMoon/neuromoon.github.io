<span style="font-size: 16px !important;">I am a postdoctoral researcher working with <a href="https://gorislab.github.io">Robbe Goris</a> at the Center for Perceptual Systems at The University of Texas at Austin. Prior to joining Robbe Goris' lab, I completed my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea where I worked with <a href="https://pal.unist.ac.kr">Oh-Sang Kwon</a>.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px !important;">My research focuses on understanding how sensory information is encoded in the brain and transformed into perceptions and thoughts that drive behavior. To address this question, I use a combination of behavioral, computational and electrophisiological techniques. I work with humans and animals to study their behavior and develop theories that explain the mental computations underlying the behavior. I also record and perturb neural signals while animals perform tasks that require various mental computations. By combining behavioral and neural data with normative theories, computational models and artificial neural networks, I aim to reveal how neural activity in the brain leads to perception, thought and, ultimately, behavior.</span>
