I am a postdoc working with Robbe Goris at the Center for Perceptual Systems, UT Austin. I use a combination of psychophysical experiments, computational models and monkey electrophysiology to study how sensory information and uncertainty associated with it are encoded in the brain and transformed into perceptions and thoughts that drive behavior.

I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea where I work with Oh-Sang Kwon and study the (sub)optimality in visual perception, using using theoretical predictions of computational models.
