<span style="font-size: 16px !important;">I am a postdoctoral researcher working with <a href="https://gorislab.github.io">Robbe Goris</a> at the Center for Perceptual Systems at UT Austin. Before joining his lab, I completed my PhD in Biomedical Engineering working with <a href="https://pal.unist.ac.kr">Oh-Sang Kwon</a> at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px !important;">My research focuses on understanding how sensory information is encoded in the brain and transformed into perceptions and thoughts that drive behavior. To address this question, I use a combination of behavioral, computational and electrophysiological techniques. I work with humans and animals to study their behavior and develop theories that explain the mental computations underlying the behavior. I also record and perturb extracellular spiking activity of neurons in the brain while animals perform tasks that require certain mental computations. By combining behavioral and neural data with normative theories, computational models and artificial neural networks, I aim to reveal how the spiking activity of neurons leads to perception, thought and, ultimately, behavior.</span>
