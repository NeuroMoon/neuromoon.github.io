<span style="font-size: 16px !important;">I am a postdoc working with <a href="https://gorislab.github.io">Robbe Goris</a> at the Center for Perceptual Systems, UT Austin. I use a combination of psychophysical experiments, computational models and monkey electrophysiology to study how sensory information is encoded in the brain and transformed into perceptions and thoughts that drive behavior.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px !important;">I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea where I worked with <a href="https://pal.unist.ac.kr">Oh-Sang Kwon</a> and studied the optimality in visual perception, using theoretical predictions from computational models.</span>
