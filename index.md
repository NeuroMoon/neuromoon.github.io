<span style="font-size: 16px !important;">I am a postdoctoral researcher working with <a href="https://gorislab.github.io">Robbe Goris</a> at the Center for Perceptual Systems at The University of Texas at Austin. My research aims to understand how sensory information is encoded in the brain and transformed into perception and thought that drive behavior.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px !important;">To address this question, I use a combination of behavioral, computational and electrophisiological techniques. I work with humans and animals to study their behavior and develop theories that govern mental computations. I also record and perturb neural signals while animals perform tasks that require various mental computations. By combining behavioral and neural data with normative theories, computational models and artificial neural networks, I aim to reveal how neural activity in the brain leads to perception, thought and, ultimately, behavior.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px !important;">Before coming to the United States, I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea where I worked with <a href="https://pal.unist.ac.kr">Oh-Sang Kwon</a> and studied how stimulus statistics in the surrounding environment influences visual processing.</span>
